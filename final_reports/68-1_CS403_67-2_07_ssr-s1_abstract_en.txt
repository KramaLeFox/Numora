NUMORA APPLICATION: PERSONAL FINANCAIL

ABSTRACT

	This report presents Numora, an Android application for personal financial 
management, designed to align with the financial behavior of Thai users. The application aims to 
help users better understand their income and expenses, control spending behavior, and build 
financial discipline through clear visualizations and straightforward recommendations. 
	Numora supports income and expense recording, transaction categorization, 
transaction tagging, recurring items, budget planning, and financial goal setting. It also incorporates 
a Dynamic 50-30-20 Rule, which adjusts allocation ratios based on users’ actual spending 
behavior, allowing the system to provide flexible recommendations for savings, essential expenses, 
and discretionary spending.
	The system is developed using the Java programming language in conjunction with an 
SQLite database and follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The 
application is designed to operate entirely offline, reducing dependency on external database 
connections, improving data access performance, and minimizing system complexity. The MVC 
architecture is applied to clearly separate the presentation, control, and data management 
components, making the system easier to maintain, modify, and extend. This separation also limits 
direct access to the data layer from the presentation layer, contributing to a more structured and 
secure overall system design.

Keywords: Personal finance, Android application, budgeting, offline-first, financial behavior.
